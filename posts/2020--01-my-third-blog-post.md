<p><strong>Tires</strong> are rubber rings that can be slipped around the <span data-filter=".green-pulley" id="green-pulley-link" class="part-link">Green Pulley</span> to convert it into a wheel. The <span data-filter=".green-pulley" id="green-pulley-link" class="part-link">Green Pulley</span> has a square center hole that will allow a square pin/shaft to be inserted and allow for a power transfer to force the pulley to spin.</p>
